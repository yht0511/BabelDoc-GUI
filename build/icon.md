# Icon Placeholder

Place your `icon.icns` file here for macOS builds.

You can generate .icns from a 1024x1024 PNG using:

- Online tools: https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns
- macOS command: `iconutil -c icns icon.iconset`

For now, electron-builder will use a default icon if this file is missing.
